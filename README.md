This project implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for classifying histopathology images from the BreakHis 400x dataset
( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/forderation/breakhis-400x ).
The dataset consists of histopathological images at a 400x magnification level, which are used to classify benign and malignant breast cancer tissue samples.
The MLP is trained to perform this binary classification, leveraging the extracted features from the images.
